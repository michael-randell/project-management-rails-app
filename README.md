# README

This is a Ruby on Rails based application used to practice and expand upon my Ruby on Rails skill set. So far I have implemented certain concepts such as the use of all associations, routing, nested routing, security practices on the front and back end, use of all RESTful methods, testing, and will be continuing to expand into further concepts.

## Get Started:
1. Install gems with 'bundle install'
2. Setup PostGreSql database with rails db:create
3. Migrate database with 'rake db:migrate'
4. Run server with 'rails s'
5. Enjoy!
